# Hangman Game

A simple command-line Hangman Game written in Python.

## Features

- **Random word selection** from a `words.txt` file
- **ASCII hangman graphics** displayed after each wrong guess
- **Tracking of player and computer scores** (wins/losses)
- **Input validation** to ensure only valid letters are entered
- **Replay option** after each round

## Installation

   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/hangman-game.git

## Usage

**To run the game, open a terminal in the project directory and execute** :

   ```


- You will see a welcome message and instructions.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters.
- If you guess a letter you've already tried, youâ€™ll be asked to pick another without losing a turn.
- After you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts, the game will show the final result and let you choose whether to play again.
